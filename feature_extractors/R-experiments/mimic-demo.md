# Trying to load different tables in the mimic demo dataset and observations

## ICU Stays
- When I loaded the ICU stays table `mimic_demo$icustays$ the subject_ids are different from what is available in the original (mimic-iv-demo/2.2)[https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo/2.2/#files-panel]. 





## Questions - 
1. What's the subset of the patient population we should be looking at? Those who were subject to a chest x-ray and received/not mech. ventilation?
